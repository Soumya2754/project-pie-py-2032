Hello,
      I am Soumya Kulhalli. This is the repository for Project Pie's Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock project [PY #2032].

Project statement:
A small gaming website wants to build a game to play Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock after its popularity from The Big Bang Theory. They have a good web developer who can make cool animations, but he is not really that good at implementing the game. Can you write functions in python to develop the game logic?

Skills needed:
Python Programming, Python Data Structures, Object Oriented Programming, Python Package Development.
